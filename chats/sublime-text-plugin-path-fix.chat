i've built a package but now i want to run it in sublime

Great — here’s a compact, actionable guide to run your package in Sublime Text for development and testing.

1) Put the package in Sublime’s Packages folder
- In Sublime: Preferences → Browse Packages. This opens the Packages directory for your installation.
- Copy the entire package folder (the one containing tune.py, package.json, syntaxes/, etc.) into that directory.
- Make sure the folder name is the name you want the package to have (this becomes the Python package namespace).

Common Packages paths:
- macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/
- Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\
- Linux: ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/

2) Reload the plugin (no restart required)
- Open the Sublime console: View → Show Console (or Ctrl+`)
- To reload Python plugin files without restarting Sublime, run in the console:
  import sublime_plugin
  sublime_plugin.reload_plugin('YourPackageName.tune')
  sublime_plugin.reload_plugin('YourPackageName.tune_jsonrpc')
Replace YourPackageName with the actual folder name and the filenames with your .py module names (no .py extension).

3) Run commands defined by your package
- If you added .sublime-commands (Default.sublime-commands), open the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for the commands there.
- To run a plugin command from the console directly:
  window.run_command('your_command_name')
The command name is the snake_case name derived from the command class. For example, a class MyFancyCommand(sublime_plugin.TextCommand) is run by window.run_command('my_fancy') or view.run_command('my_fancy') depending on command type (WindowCommand vs TextCommand/WindowCommand usage). If unsure, inspect your Python classes (they inherit from sublime_plugin.TextCommand / WindowCommand / ApplicationCommand).

4) Use/activate syntaxes, color schemes, keymaps and settings
- Syntax: Open a file and set syntax via View → Syntax → Other… or select your package’s .sublime-syntax (e.g., "Chat").
- Key bindings in Default.sublime-keymap will be active automatically if loaded and no conflicts exist.
- Color scheme in color-schemes/ will be selectable from Preferences → Color Scheme.

5) Debugging tips
- Use print(...) in your plugin code; output appears in the Sublime console.
- If plugin fails to load, check the console for Traceback/errors — they usually show import errors or syntax errors with filename/line.
- If a plugin change doesn’t appear, ensure you reloaded the plugin or restarted Sublime.

6) For distribution (optional)
- To create an installable package, zip the package contents and rename to YourPackageName.sublime-package and place in Installed Packages directory, or publish via Package Control.

If you want, tell me:
- the name of the package folder (so I can give exact reload commands), or
- which command or file you want to run (I can show the exact window.run_command or reload_plugin lines to use).

ok, my tune-sdk is install globally but i use nvm /Users/iovdin/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/tune-sdk 
and sublime can not find it, because  /Users/iovdin/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin not in the path
What is the best way to solve it?

do not read anything just answer

Short answer: either put the tune-sdk binary on a PATH that GUI apps see, or make your plugin call the exact binary (or start a login shell that sources nvm). The simplest/most reliable options:

1) Symlink the binary into a standard location
- Easiest: create a symlink in /usr/local/bin (or another dir GUI apps already have in PATH).
  ln -s /Users/iovdin/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/tune-sdk /usr/local/bin/tune-sdk
- Advantages: no package change, Sublime will find it like any other binary.

2) Have Sublime/plugin call tune-sdk via a login shell that sources nvm
- If your plugin invokes commands with subprocess, run them through a login shell that sources nvm/init script so the nvm PATH gets set:
  subprocess.run(['bash', '-lc', 'source "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh" && tune-sdk <args>'])
- Or explicitly include full path:
  subprocess.run(['/Users/iovdin/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/tune-sdk', '<args>'])

3) Add a configurable setting in your package
- Add a setting like "tune_sdk_path": "/Users/iovdin/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/tune-sdk" to Chat.sublime-settings and use that path in your plugin. This is robust and user-configurable.

4) (More macOS-specific) Set a PATH for GUI apps via launchctl
- You can use launchctl setenv PATH "..." at login (via a LaunchAgent). This is more invasive and OS-specific; it requires logging out/in and is generally less convenient than a symlink or explicit path.

My recommendation: create the symlink in /usr/local/bin for a quick fix, and add a package setting for tune_sdk_path so users (and you) can override it without editing plugin code. If you want, tell me which approach you prefer and I can give the exact commands or a small plugin patch/snippet.
