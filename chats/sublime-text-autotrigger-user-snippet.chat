what is a way to trigger snippet "user:" when user entered ^u in sublime?
assistant:
Use a key binding that runs the insert_snippet command.

1) If you already have a snippet file (e.g., Packages/User/user.sublime-snippet):
- Preferences > Key Bindings (User) → add:
{ "keys": ["ctrl+u"], "command": "insert_snippet", "args": { "name": "Packages/User/user.sublime-snippet" } }

2) If you just want Ctrl+U to insert/expand the snippet contents directly:
- Preferences > Key Bindings (User) → add:
{ "keys": ["ctrl+u"], "command": "insert_snippet", "args": { "contents": "user: $0" } }

Notes:
- Ctrl+U is bound to soft_undo by default; this will override it. Pick another combo if you want to keep soft undo (e.g., ctrl+alt+u).
- To limit where it works, add a context, e.g.:
{ "keys": ["ctrl+u"], "command": "insert_snippet", "args": { "name": "Packages/User/user.sublime-snippet" }, "context": [{ "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "source" }] }

is it possible to autotrigger like autosuggest when "u" has entered at the beginning of a line?
assistant:
Short answer: not purely with settings. You can make the autocomplete popup appear after typing u, but restricting it to “at the beginning of the line” (and/or auto-expanding) needs a tiny plugin.

Options:

A) Settings-only: show the autocomplete popup after u anywhere
- Create a snippet or completion with trigger “user” and contents “user: ”.
- Settings → add:
"auto_complete_triggers": [{ "selector": "text, source", "characters": "u" }]
This pops the AC list after u; the snippet will be offered (you still need Tab/Enter to commit). Note: this can’t be limited to “beginning of line” via settings alone.

B) Small plugin: only trigger at beginning of line (shows autosuggest)
1) Save this as Packages/User/u_bol_ac.py:
import sublime, sublime_plugin

class UAtBolAutoComplete(sublime_plugin.EventListener):
    def on_modified(self, view):
        sels = view.sel()
        if len(sels) != 1:
            return
        pt = sels[0].b
        if pt == 0:
            return
        # last typed char must be 'u'
        if view.substr(sublime.Region(pt-1, pt)) != 'u':
            return
        line = view.line(pt)
        # Check that 'u' is the first non-whitespace on the line
        if view.substr(sublime.Region(line.begin(), pt)).strip() == 'u':
            view.run_command("auto_complete")
Now when you type u as the first non-whitespace char on a line, the autocomplete popup opens and will include your “user: …” snippet/completion.

C) Small plugin: auto-expand to “user: ” at beginning of line
1) Save as Packages/User/u_bol_expand.py:
import sublime, sublime_plugin

class UAtBolExpandUser(sublime_plugin.EventListener):
    def on_modified(self, view):
        sels = view.sel()
        if len(sels) != 1:
            return
        pt = sels[0].b
        if pt == 0:
            return
        if view.substr(sublime.Region(pt-1, pt)) != 'u':
            return
        line = view.line(pt)
        if view.substr(sublime.Region(line.begin(), pt)).strip() == 'u':
            # replace the just-typed 'u' with the snippet
            view.run_command("left_delete")
            view.run_command("insert_snippet", {"contents": "user: $0"})
Notes:
- Use a snippet/completion with trigger “user” (not “user:”) because : is a word separator and won’t match well as a trigger. Put the colon in the snippet contents.
- If you only want this in certain syntaxes, wrap the checks with a scope test (e.g., if not view.match_selector(pt, "source.yaml"): return).
